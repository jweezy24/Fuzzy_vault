# Fuzzy Vault Algorithm built for binary streams

This repo contains an implementation of the fuzzy vault algorithm. This code is designed to work with bit stream data sets.


## Functionality

    1) Fully reduced echelon form algorithm

    2) Hand-made Reed-Solomon decoder using Berlekamp's algorithm

    3) Fully Fuzzy Vault implementation for bit streams.




## Installing

This repo uses a make file to build the code. Run the command `make fuzzy`.

To run the code, run the command `make run`.


## Requirements

* [C](http://gcc.gnu.org/install/) - The compiler for C (All C dependencies will be installed with make file)


## Future Plans

I want to implement functionality with other datasets. For now all I have functional is the the bitstream dataset.
